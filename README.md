# Image-segmentation-using-modified-UNET
### implemented this neural network with the help from youtube video of Alladin Persson : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHq1t7NxS8k
### Since network has near about 31 million parameters it was difficult for me to train model on my local device.
### I will try to train it and upload it with the model file
